#### Know programming but new to game development?

> :exclamation: "Design patterns" can be more **harmful** than good. They are **not building blocks nor hard-fast-rules** for building computer programs. They are tools for developers to communicate to other developers about their **already built programs**. Fortunately, the first introduction chapter of the above link does a great job of explaining what design is, and is not, in the context of software development, and more specifically game development.

#### New to or need a refresher on vectors and matrices?

> :exclamation: Linear algebra is the study of vectors, matrices, and basic geometric shapes like lines, triangles, planes, and how they rotate. If your game involves the position of a button, the direction of a camera, or the velocity of a race car, you will have to use vectors. If you need to rotate a planet, you will need to use matrices. The better you understand linear algebra, the more control you will have over the behaviour of your game.

#### Don't know what are "Model View Projection" matrices or how they work?
