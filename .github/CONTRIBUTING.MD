# How to Contribute to `sokol.NET`

Please read the [code of conduct](CONTRIBUTING-CODE-CONDUCT.md) before contributing.

At least one maintainer will respond to an issue or comment in under 48 hours under normal circumstances. See the [list of MAINTAINERS](https://github.com/lithiumtoast/Sokol.NET/blob/develop/MAINTAINERS.md) for details about time-zones, countries of living, and circumstances of maintainers.

## Getting Started

Head over to the [issue tracker](https://github.com/lithiumtoast/Sokol.NET/issues) and find an issue labeled as `good first issue` or `help wanted`. Then comment to elect yourself and one of our maintainers will assign you the issue!

## Changes in Documentation

Please make a draft pull request without creating an issue. The draft is used to start a discussion and refinement of the documentation. If necessary, maintainers may need to commit changes on your pull request branch for refinement.

## Changes in Code

If you are not assigned an issue, please create an issue to start a conversation about the desired code changes and triage the issue. If the issue is triaged, assigned to you, and a clear course of action is available, please create a pull request. Maintainers may need to commit changes on your pull request for refinement.

If the pull-request was merge successfully, your GitHub handle will be added to [list of CONTRIBUTORS](https://github.com/lithiumtoast/Sokol.NET/blob/develop/CONTRIBUTORS.md). Note that contributors are considered "authors" in legal terms but they automatically assign the ownership rights to the active owner upon a successful merge. This is the [basic norm of open source licensing where inbound = outbound](https://opensource.com/law/11/7/trouble-harmony-part-1#contribution-policies-and-free-software-tradition). For more information about the owners, see the [OWNERS](https://github.com/lithiumtoast/Sokol.NET/blob/develop/OWNERS.md) file.
